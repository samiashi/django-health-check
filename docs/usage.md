# Usage

## Setting up monitoring

You can use tools like Pingdom, StatusCake or other uptime robots to
monitor service status. The `/health/` endpoint will respond with an HTTP
200 if all checks passed and with an HTTP 500 if any of the tests
failed.

For concrete, step-by-step examples of multi-tier endpoint setups including
uptime monitoring, container probes, reverse-proxy configuration, and RSS/Atom
integration into Slack or Matrix, see the [Cookbook](cookbook.md).

## Getting machine-readable reports

### Plain text

For simple monitoring and scripting, you can request plain text output with the `Accept` HTTP header set to `text/plain` or pass `format=text` as a query parameter.

The endpoint will return a plain text response with HTTP 200 if all checks passed and HTTP 500 if any check failed:

```shell
$ curl -v -X GET -H "Accept: text/plain" http://www.example.com/health/

> GET /health/ HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> Accept: text/plain
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

CacheBackend: OK
DatabaseBackend: OK
S3BotoStorageHealthCheck: OK

$ curl -v -X GET http://www.example.com/health/?format=text

> GET /health/?format=text HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

CacheBackend: OK
DatabaseBackend: OK
S3BotoStorageHealthCheck: OK
```

This format is particularly useful for command-line tools and simple monitoring scripts that don't need the overhead of JSON parsing.

### JSON

If you want machine-readable status reports you can request the `/health/`
endpoint with the `Accept` HTTP header set to `application/json` or pass
`format=json` as a query parameter.

The backend will return a JSON response:

```shell
$ curl -v -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://www.example.com/health/

> GET /health/ HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
> Accept: application/json
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json

{
    "CacheBackend": "working",
    "DatabaseBackend": "working",
    "S3BotoStorageHealthCheck": "working"
}

$ curl -v -X GET http://www.example.com/health/?format=json

> GET /health/?format=json HTTP/1.1
> Host: www.example.com
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: application/json

{
    "CacheBackend": "working",
    "DatabaseBackend": "working",
    "S3BotoStorageHealthCheck": "working"
}
```

### OpenMetrics for Prometheus

For Prometheus monitoring, you can request OpenMetrics format:

```shell
$ curl http://www.example.com/health/?format=openmetrics
```

This will return metrics in the OpenMetrics exposition format, which can be scraped by Prometheus.

### RSS and Atom feeds

For RSS feed readers and monitoring tools, you can request RSS or Atom format:

```shell
$ curl http://www.example.com/health/?format=rss
$ curl http://www.example.com/health/?format=atom
```

You can also use the `Accept` header:

```shell
$ curl -H "Accept: application/rss+xml" http://www.example.com/health/
$ curl -H "Accept: application/atom+xml" http://www.example.com/health/
```

These endpoints always return a 200 status code with health check results in the feed content.
Failed checks are indicated by categories and item descriptions.

## Writing a custom health check

You can write your own health checks by inheriting from
[HealthCheck][health_check.HealthCheck] and implementing the `run` method.

::: health_check.HealthCheck

## Django command

You can run the Django command `health_check` to perform your health
checks via the command line, or periodically with a cron, as follows:

```shell
django-admin health_check health_check
```

The `endpoint` argument is the `name` of the health check URL pattern defined in your
`urls.py` (see the [installation guide](install.md)); the command resolves it via
`reverse()`. The example above runs the checks over HTTP against the running server:

```
Database                 ... OK
CustomHealthCheck        ... Unavailable: Something went wrong!
```

Pass `--no-http` to run the checks directly without an HTTP server, which is useful for
container health checks where no web server needs to be running:

```shell
django-admin health_check health_check --no-http
```

A critical error will cause the command to quit with the exit code `1`.

## Performance tweaks

All checks are executed asynchronously, either via `asyncio` or via a thread pool,
depending on the implementation of the individual checks.
This allows for concurrent execution of the IO-bound checks,
which reduces the response time.

The event loop's default executor is used to run synchronous checks
(e.g. [Database][health_check.checks.Database], [Mail][health_check.checks.Mail],
or [Storage][health_check.checks.Storage]) in a thread pool.
This pool is usually persisted across requests. This may lead to high performance while
permanently allocating more memory. This may be undesirable for some applications,
especially with `S3Storage`, which uses thread-local connections.

This can be mitigated by using a custom executor that creates a new
thread pool for each request, which is then cleaned up after the checks
are completed. This can be achieved by subclassing `HealthCheckView`
and overriding the `get_executor` method to return a context manager
providing a new `ThreadPoolExecutor` instance for each request.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from health_check.views import HealthCheckView


class CustomHealthCheckView(HealthCheckView):
    def get_executor(self):
        return ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(self.checks))
```

This approach ensures that each request gets a fresh thread pool,
which can help manage memory usage more effectively
while still providing the benefits of concurrent execution for synchronous checks.
